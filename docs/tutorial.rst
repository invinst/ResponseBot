Authenticate
------------

ResponseBot uses Twitter API, which requires authentication. To do so, you need to register an application with Twitter
`here <https://apps.twitter.com/>`_. Twitter will provide your app with a consumer key & secret pair, you need to
generate an additional app token key & secret pair from your app management panel. After you have the credentials,
put it under the :code:`[auth]` section in the :code:`.responsebot` configuration file in your project root (or
whichever directory you run ResponseBot from).

.. code-block:: ini

   [auth]
   consumer_key = <consumer_key>
   consumer_secret = <consumer_secret>
   token_key = <token_key>
   token_secret = <token_secret>

If the credentials you provided are correct, when you run ResponseBot it should show like below

.. code-block:: bash

   $ start_responsebot --handlers-package <path_to_handler>
     [INFO] 2016-05-04 10:54:13 ResponseBot started
     [INFO] 2016-05-04 10:54:16 Successfully authenticated as <twitter_screen_name>

Otherwise it should show an error

.. code-block:: bash

     [ERROR] 2016-05-04 10:52:17 Could not authenticate.

Handler
-------

To receive an incoming tweet, you need to subclass :code:`BaseTweetHandler` and implement the :code:`on_tweet` method.
You can specify what kind of tweets the bot should listen to by returning an appropriate
`TweetFilter <reference/responsebot.models.html#TweetFilter>`_ in the :code:`get_filter` method.

.. code-block:: python

   class MyTweetHandler(BaseTweetHandler):
       def on_tweet(self, tweet):
           print('Received tweet: %s from %s' % (tweet.text, tweet.user.screen_name))

See what :code:`tweet` object contains in `reference <reference/responsebot.models.html#Tweet>`_.

Client
------

If your application want to post a reply to the received tweet, you can use ResponseBot's Twitter client to do so:

.. code-block:: python

   class MyTweetHandler(BaseTweetHandler):
       def on_tweet(self, tweet):
           self.client.tweet('Howdy @%s' % tweet.user.screen_name)

The :code:`client` object can also retweet, get or delete a specific tweet by ID. See `reference <reference/responsebot.responsebot_client.html>`_.
